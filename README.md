# GraphQL Federation POC with Java

This repository contains the Proof of Concept (POC) for implementing GraphQL federation using Java technologies. The POC explores the technical feasibility of federating GraphQL services, resolving simple and complex queries, and creating a unified schema from multiple subgraph endpoints.
Objectives

The main objective of this POC is to determine whether it's technically feasible to implement GraphQL federation using Java technologies. Specific objectives include:

    Identifying suitable tools and libraries in the Java ecosystem for supporting GraphQL federation.
    Evaluating the capabilities of these tools for subgraph creation and federation.
    Analyzing querying capabilities for simple and complex queries.

Scenarios

The POC covers the following scenarios:

    Creation of federated graph by federating Subgraph endpoints
    Resolving a Simple Query
    Resolving a Complex Query - Nested
    Resolving a Complex Query - multiple queries in the same level

Implementation

The implementation details for each scenario are provided in the repository. This includes information on libraries used, steps taken, and expected outputs.
