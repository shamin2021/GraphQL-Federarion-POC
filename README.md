**Objectives** \n
Determine whether it's technically feasible to implement GraphQL federation using Java technologies by Identifying the suitable tools and libraries in the Java ecosystem that support GraphQL federation and evaluate their capabilities for subgraph creation and federation 

**Summary**
Develop the necessary components and services using Java to create a federated GraphQL system. Here the subgraph creation using Java and federation - combining the independent services through java was explored. Further the querying capabilities were analyzed for a simple query , and complex query (including nested queries and multiple queries in the same level). The ability of the federated service to generate a query plan and resolve the independent services one by one to respond accurately was also explored.
